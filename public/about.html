<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[18][19] He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite..</p>

<p>The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes".[32] Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist[33][34] and to train his body into physical perfection[33][34] to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind.[33][34] He also speaks over 40 languages.</p>

<p>Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order".[37] Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,[38] a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty conscience</p>
